# PredatorPreySim

This Python script simulates the interaction between prey and predators on a grid. The simulation uses random movement for both prey and predators and includes basic rules for predator feeding and starvation. Predators have vision and the prey are designed to attempt and escape the preadators. The simulation results are visualized using Matplotlib's animation functionality.
